<h1>Reactive DOM</h1>
<code>@easedotjs/reactive-dom</code>

<p>
  Reactive DOM is an extension that allows you to create reactive components that automatically update the DOM when their values change. 
  This extension is built on top of the <a href="#extensions/reactive.html">Reactive</a> extension, and provides a simple way to create 
  reactive components that update the DOM in real-time. As such, you will need to include both the Reactive and Reactive DOM extensions in
  your project to use this extension.
</p>

<p>
  To use the Reactive DOM extension, you will need to include the <code>@easedotjs/reactive-dom</code> script in your HTML file. This will 
  automatically load the extension and make it available to your components. Once the extension is loaded, you can use {{ }} to create
  reactive elements and they will appear within <code>rx</code> in your component's script:
</p>

<template lang="html">
<template>
  <span id="message">{{ message }}</span>
</template>

<script>
export default ({ rx }) => {
  rx.message = 'Hello World!';
};
</script>
</template>

<p>
  Additional functionality is planned such as conditional rendering, loops, and more. Check back soon for updates!

# Ease

Ease is a simple, lightweight, and flexible web component library that lets you build web applications with just HTML and JavaScript.

By design, Ease is modular and extensible, so you can pull in the features you want and skip the ones you don't. With very little to learn, 
anyone familiar with HTML can get started with Ease.

Ease's simplicity and minimalism also makes it extremely flexible, usable with virtually any web development stack. It's perfect for building small, 
simple components or large, complex applications. You can create component libraries and load them from anywhere, you can use it with other libraries
such as <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> or <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>. Ease makes creating components as simple as writing HTML.
